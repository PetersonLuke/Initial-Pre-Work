    Changed both the variables declarations and assignments, as variables need to have the same case, to the best practice of camelCase.

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar ;
var properCamelCase ;
var titleCaseOver ;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar  = 10;
properCamelCase  = "A String";
titleCaseOver  = 9000;
