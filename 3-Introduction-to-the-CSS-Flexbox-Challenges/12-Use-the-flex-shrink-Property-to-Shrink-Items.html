    flex-shrink was used to allow items to shrink in the flex container.  The items will shrink if they are too large for the container and based on the value given to the flex-shrink, is based on how much each on will shrink.  A larger number will make the item shrink more.

  #box-container {
    display: flex;

  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 1;
  }

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 2;
