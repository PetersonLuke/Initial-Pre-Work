                        Edwin Pepping, Albert Mampre, Earnest Oats, and Eugene Roe served as Combat Medics attached to Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, also known as “Band of Brothers”. Their combat tour brought them through some of the hardest fighting during the war, but they were armed only with basic medical equipment.  The men of Easy company refered to these Medics as the "Band-aid Bandits".
