    Showed how the order of css works by added a second class of bluetext to the h1 element.  With the blue-text being after the pink-text class in the style section, the h1 was changed to blue.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    font-family: monospace;
    color: green;
  }
  .pink-text {
    color: pink;
  }

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
<h1 class="pink-text blue-text" >Hello World!</h1>
